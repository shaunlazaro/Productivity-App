# OnTrack
A small productivity app using visual c#
The GetOnTrack.exe file can be found in the bin/debug folder, or the bin/release folder.
The debug folder has the latest version in development, while the release folder has the latest "stable" version.
Note that there are two files titled GetOnTrack.exe, and one of them isn't actually
an exe file, but a .config file with .exe in its name (GetOnTrack.exe.config).
